# Sick Picks

## What is a Sick Pick?

At the end of each [SyntaxFM podcast](http://syntax.fm), a few Sick Picks are given - basically recommendations on products, podcasts, music - anything the hosts are into currently. I built a web scraper [here](https://github.com/trybick/sick-picks-scraper) which collects the data for this app to display.

## Local Development

To run this project for local development follow these steps in a terminal. The app will run on port 3000.
